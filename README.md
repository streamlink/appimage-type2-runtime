# AppImage type2-runtime

This is a fork of [AppImage/type2-runtime](https://github.com/AppImage/type2-runtime) with a modification of the build and deploy config, so Streamlink can rely on stable, non-rolling releases for its own various Linux AppImage builds. Please see the upstream documentation for more information.
